== Welcome to FoRuby

FoRuby is a personal project of Matthew Follett, to develop a forum using Ruby on
Rails. The name ForRuby comes from combining <b>For</b>um and <b>Ruby</b>.

Since this was a learning expierence, the tests were written after some features,
so that the author could worry more about getting features working properly, rather
then passing tests.
